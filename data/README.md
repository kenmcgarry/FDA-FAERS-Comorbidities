# **Important!
The files downloaded from the FDA are really huge, not surprising really as they contain data relating to every reported adverse drug effect in the USA that occurred in 2016 - GitHub wont allow anything bugger than 25MB. I managed to get the INDICATIONS, OUTC and RPSC data for the four quarters of 2016 into one or two zips each but DRUG and REAC are individual zip files for the  four quarters of 2016 - sorry! It's either my zip files or download direct from FDA using the URL at the bottom of the page.

FAERS (Adverse Event Reporting System )are available both in ASCII and XML formats. The ASCII files are encoded
in UTF-8, which provides for the most compact practical form of information storage;
although this also occasionally causes question marks to (literally) appear when characters
are used that are not encoded by UTF-8. A quarterly report contains several subsets
of information:

– `Demographics (DEMO)`; basic patient information.

– `Drug types (DRUG)`; a list of drugs administered to patients. 

– `Indications (INDI)`; why they were given the drug initially.

– `Outcomes (OUTC)`; the end result, e.g. hospitalisation, death.

– `Reactions (REAC)`; side effect(s) experienced.

– `Reporting sources (RPSR)`; where the information originated from.

– `Therapy types (THER)`; how and when the drug was administered.

These files can be obtained from:
