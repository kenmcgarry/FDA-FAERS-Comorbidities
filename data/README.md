# **Important!
The files downloaded from the FDA are really huge - GitHub wont allow anything bugger than 25MB. I managed to get the INDICATIONS for the four quarters of 2016 into one zip but the others are individual zip files - sorry! It's either my zip files or downlaod direct from FDA.

AERS are available both in ASCII and XML formats. The ASCII files are encoded
in UTF-8, which provides for the most compact practical form of information storage;
although this also occasionally causes question marks to (literally) appear when characters
are used that are not encoded by UTF-8. A quarterly report contains several subsets
of information:
– Demographics (DEMO); basic patient information.
– Drug types (DRUG); a list of drugs administered to patients (Table 1).
– Indications (INDI); why they were given the drug initially.
– Outcomes (OUTC); the end result, e.g. hospitalisation, death.
– Reactions (REAC); side effect(s) experienced (Table 2).
– Reporting sources (RPSR); where the information originated from.
– Therapy types (THER); how and when the drug was administered.
